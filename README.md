### File respoitory for challenge contains:
- credit_risk_classification.ipnyb
- Resources folder containing lending_data.csv
- Starter_Code folder containing original initially provided code

found at: https://github.com/TRegan5/credit-risk-classification

## Goal
Train and evaluate a model based on loan risk to identify creditworthiness of borrowers, using various techniques and a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

## Methods
1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Credit Risk Analysis Report
### Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to classify the creditworthiness of borrowers based on a logistic regression model generated a hitorical lending activity dataset. Loan status of borrowers is classified as either `healthy` or `high risk`.

### Results
Results of the generated model produced the following classification scores:
- Accuracy score: 0.99; 
- Precision score: 
    - Healthy loan status: 1.00; 
    - High risk loan status: 0.87; 
- Recall score: 
    - Healthy loan status: 1.00; 
    - High risk loan status: 0.89;
